* In this project, we will link two amazing worlds: Databases and Python!
* In the first part, we will use the module MySQLdb to connect to a MySQL database and execute the SQL queries.
* In the second part, we will use the module SQLAlchemy, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
<hr>
<p>The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage.
<br>With an ORM, your biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”.
<br>You won’t write any SQL queries only Python code.
<br>Last thing, your code won’t be “storage type” dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.</p>
