* In this project, we will link two amazing worlds: `Databases` and `Python` !
* In the first part, we will use the module `MySQLdb` to connect to a `MySQL database` and execute the SQL queries.
* In the second part, we will use the module `SQLAlchemy`, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
<hr>
* The biggest difference is: no more SQL queries! Indeed, the purpose of an ORM is to abstract the storage to the usage.
* With an ORM, your biggest concern will be “What can I do with my objects” and not “How this object is stored? where? when?”.
* You won’t write any SQL queries only Python code.
* Last thing, your code won’t be “storage type” dependent. You will be able to change your storage easily without re-writing your entire project.
